# Power-Management-Strategy-of-an-Electric-Drive-System
The major contribution of this work is to propose an efficient power managementstrategy using fuzzy logic controller so that the performance of electric drive system is comparable to that of an IC engine vehicle. In a motor vehicle, a power train comprises all the main components thatgenerate power. The power train consists of two electric drives to cater to the high speed and torque requirements of the electric vehicle. The proposed idea is to implement fuzzy logic on the vehicle power train to improve efficiency as well as drawing less voltage from the power source which is the battery using the techniques of voltage matching and forward driving. The
adopted methodology will ensure that high power requirements are met taking the various losses involved into consideration. Implementation is done using Fuzzy Logic Control on vehicle powertrain for power management and improving state-of-health of battery using Forward Driving and Voltage matching Technique. This work has been done using MATLAB-Simulink.
